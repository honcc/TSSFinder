TSSFinder
=========

This is a Perl script that finds the transcription start sites by comparing the read5End pileups of two types of libraries: 5'biased (e.g. CAGE, TEX-Seq or csRNA)  and Standard RNA-Seq. It uses the standard RNA-Seq track to define the background and picks up the signals from the 5'biased library.
